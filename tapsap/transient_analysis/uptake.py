    """

    Calculation of the uptake as the cumulative integral of the rate. The rate can be given from previous calculations or by the Y or G Procedure
    
    Args:
        rate (float ndarray): The gas rate (temporal) of the given flux.

        times (float ndarray): An array of time.

    Returns:
        uptake (float ndarray): The uptake (temporal) of the given rate.
