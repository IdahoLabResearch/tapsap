def calculate_residence_time(zone_lengths: dict, zone_porosity: dict, zone_diffusion: dict) -> dict:
    """

    Calculate the residence time within the each zone in the reactor.
    Please note that some manuscripts either invert the residence time or scale by a factor of one half.
    This residence time calculation is done via Constales et al.
    See other citations to note the difference in implementation.
    
    Args:
        zone_lengths (dict): The zone lengths for the reactor, e.g., {0.002, 0.000001, 0.002}

        zone_diffusion (dict): The diffusion coefficient for each zone

        zone_porosity (dict): The bed porosity within each zone

    Returns:
        zone_residence_time (dict): The residence time within each zone
